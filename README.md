# weightlosscalc
This project is a tkinter project for test purposes.
I want to test how efficient and usable the Tkinter library is. There will be more updates in the future, where: 
1. Data can be deleted 
2. Several useful analysis methods are used 
3. AI is used for meaningful forecasts 
4. Comparisons are made with data via API interfaces 
5. Log in and account management are possible 
The project should be able to be installed and used as a.exe via the pyinstaller. 
There are delays due to time constraints. 
I am always happy about voluntary cooperations. 
My thanks to rdbende (https://github.com/rdbende/Forest-ttk-theme) for the great Excel light/dark theme.

Current time required: approx. 5 hours
